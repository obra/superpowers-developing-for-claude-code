# Professional Greeting

When the user asks you to help write a greeting (email, message, letter opening), use this skill to ensure professional and appropriate tone.

## Context Detection

First, determine:
1. **Relationship**: Is this for a colleague, client, superior, or someone you don't know?
2. **Formality level**: Professional formal, professional casual, or friendly professional?
3. **Purpose**: Introduction, follow-up, request, thank you, or general correspondence?
4. **Cultural context**: Any specific cultural considerations mentioned?

## Greeting Selection Rules

### For First Contact or Formal Situations
- Unknown recipient or very formal: "Dear [Name/Title],"
- Professional but less formal: "Hello [Name],"
- Multiple recipients: "Dear Team," or "Hello everyone,"

### For Established Professional Relationships
- Colleague (casual): "Hi [Name],"
- Colleague (formal): "Hello [Name],"
- Regular client: "Hi [Name]," or "Hello [Name],"

### For Follow-ups Within Same Thread
- Quick follow-up: "Thanks for the quick response," or "[Name],"
- Continuing discussion: "Thanks," or just continue the conversation

## Time-Based Greetings

Only use time-based greetings ("Good morning/afternoon") when:
- You know the recipient's timezone
- The message is truly time-sensitive
- It's a live conversation, not async email

## What to Avoid

- Never use "To whom it may concern" (too impersonal)
- Avoid "Hey" in formal contexts
- Don't use "Dear Sir/Madam" (outdated and assumes gender)
- Skip exclamation marks in initial professional contact
- Avoid overly casual openers like "What's up" or "Yo" in professional settings

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **Recommended greeting**: The specific greeting text
2. **Rationale**: Brief explanation of why this greeting fits
3. **Alternative**: One backup option if they want to adjust formality
4. **Opening sentence suggestion**: A natural first sentence that flows from the greeting

## Example

User: "Help me write an email to a new client I'm meeting next week"

Output:
```
Recommended greeting: "Hello [Client Name],"

Rationale: This strikes a balance between professional and approachable for a first-time client interaction. It's formal enough to show respect but not overly stiff.

Alternative: "Dear [Client Name]," if you want to err on the more formal side

Opening sentence suggestion: "Thank you for taking the time to meet with me next week. I'm looking forward to discussing [topic]."
```

## Special Cases

- **Bad news**: Use formal greeting, avoid cheerfulness
- **Apology**: More formal than usual previous communication
- **Celebration**: Match the enthusiasm level to your relationship
- **Request from someone senior**: Lean formal
- **Thank you note**: Can be slightly warmer than typical communication

## Process

1. Ask clarifying questions if context is unclear
2. Provide your recommendation with rationale
3. Offer to adjust if they want more/less formality
4. Draft the full opening (greeting + first 1-2 sentences) for their approval
